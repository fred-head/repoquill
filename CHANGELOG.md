# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Added fail-closed single-owner password authentication, persistent server-side
  sessions, session-bound CSRF protection, trusted-proxy handling, progressive
  throttling, operator-only recovery, and an explicit unauthenticated mode.
- Added optional password-first TOTP MFA with local QR generation, encrypted
  secrets, replay protection, atomically single-use recovery codes, safe factor
  replacement, and separate operator MFA reset.
- Added the Milestone 19 adversarial route/MFA/session test matrix and a current
  OWASP-oriented Alpha 2 authentication review and release gate.

### Added

- Responsive setup, login, reauthentication, Security settings, active-session
  administration, MFA enrollment/recovery, and visible disabled-mode guidance
  for browser and installed PWA use.
- Recoverable Trash with deliberate restore, note-focused Git history with safe
  restore, and portable internal note links with broken-link detection and
  rename/move rewriting.
- Complete notebook management and beginner-oriented provider-independent SSH
  onboarding, including a guided GitHub deploy-key path.
- Guided conflict review that preserves both sides and handles Markdown,
  delete/modify, rename/move, images, and binary files without requiring normal
  users to repair Git manually.
- An original-asset image lightbox with accessible fit/actual-size inspection in
  Edit, Read only, desktop, mobile, and installed PWA contexts.
- Responsive Small, Medium, Large, and Full inline image presentation
  presets that persist outside Git without changing Markdown or original image
  assets, apply in Edit and Read only modes, and retain original-asset lightbox
  inspection.

### Changed

- Milkdown kit/react now use 7.22.1. RepoQuill's empty-cursor inline-code mode
  preserves its explicit start/type/stop behavior across Milkdown's safer
  non-inclusive code-mark boundary, with a dedicated regression test.
- Frontend builds, CI, release jobs, and local-development requirements now use
  Node.js 24 LTS, with compatible Testing Library, React type, and
  TypeScript-ESLint patch/minor updates applied reproducibly.
- The maintained frontend toolchain now uses Vite 8, ESLint 10, Vitest 4,
  jsdom 30, and the latest TypeScript release officially supported by
  typescript-eslint.
- Human-readable synchronization details now distinguish locally saved content
  from remote synchronization, report received changes, and keep note switching
  responsive while Git work continues safely in the background.
- Notes can be opened in session-scoped tabs; tabs follow supported note moves
  and close safely when their files are deleted.
- Fresh installations begin with explicit notebook onboarding instead of a
  synthetic local notebook. Inactive legacy registrations can be removed
  without deleting their files.
- Alpha 2 deployment, authentication, onboarding, synchronization, conflict,
  image, upgrade, recovery, and limitation documentation now matches the
  implemented application.

### Fixed

- The browser-provided PWA installation suggestion can be dismissed, and the
  choice remains dismissed in that browser.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1.security.1] - 2026-08-26

### Security

- Rebuilt the runtime from current Alpine packages to replace OpenSSL
  `3.5.7-r0`, flagged by CVE-2026-14456, with the fixed package line.
- Established a zero-open-alert source baseline across CodeQL, Dependabot, and
  secret scanning after reviewing every historical source-to-sink finding.

### Changed

- Request logging now strips control characters and limits attacker-controlled
  fields, while all user-facing filesystem paths reject control characters in
  addition to traversal, absolute paths, reserved directories, and symlinks.
- GitHub-owned setup/checkout actions and Gitleaks now use their Node 24-capable
  release lines, and every workflow action remains pinned to an immutable SHA.
- Security maintenance now includes daily source, dependency, secret, freshly
  built image, immutable release image, and moving-channel image surveillance.
- Alpha publishing verifies immutable image aliases before moving the channel
  tag and creates a prerelease record with digest, SBOM/provenance, migration,
  and rollback guidance.
- Dependency updates follow an explicit human-review policy with complete
  functional, runtime, and security gates and no automatic merge or deployment.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Public alpha contribution guidance, supported-version security reporting, and
  a consolidated known-limitations document.
- Apache License 2.0 project licensing and matching package/container metadata.
- Fail-closed release gates for race detection, Go/npm vulnerability auditing,
  Git-history secret scanning, image vulnerability scanning, hardened container
  startup, health verification, and persistent Markdown survival.
- Tag-gated GHCR publishing for signed, SBOM-attested `linux/amd64` and
  `linux/arm64` images with immutable version/SHA tags and the moving
  `0.1.0-alpha` channel.
- Milestone 10 alpha hardening with same-origin protection for mutations, restrictive browser security headers, strict API fallbacks, request limits, and release/security documentation.
- Strict notebook onboarding validation that permits SSH remotes only, rejects local paths and unsafe Git protocols, and validates branch names before invoking Git.
- Hardened container defaults: localhost-only published port, read-only root filesystem, dropped Linux capabilities, no-new-privileges, and a constrained temporary filesystem.
- Release and CI builds now use the supported Go 1.26 toolchain line.
- Milestone 8 mobile notebook drawer, browser-provided install action, standalone manifest metadata, safe-area support, and explicit online-first offline messaging.
- Application-shell-only service-worker precaching; API responses and note contents are never added to the offline cache.

- Milestone 9 contextual slash-command menu for headings, lists, tasks, quotes, code, links, images, tables, and horizontal rules using the existing portable Milkdown commands.
- Keyboard filtering, arrow-key navigation, Enter/Escape handling, and touch-friendly command selection without proprietary Markdown syntax.
- One-command local development launcher for preparing persistent test directories and running the Go backend plus Vite together.
- Milestone 7 notebook search across folder names, Markdown filenames, and note contents with line-aware, clickable sidebar results.
- Confined backend search that ignores Git metadata, dependency trees, note asset directories, symlinks, non-Markdown content, and oversized notes.
- Configurable scheduled Git sync, editing-inactivity sync, notebook-switch sync, and best-effort tab-close sync using the existing conflict-safe synchronization service.
- Conflict-reducing sync triggers for application startup, returning focus, and opening another note.
- Browser-local sync preferences with independent interval, inactivity, switch, and close controls in Settings.
- Request-detached backend background sync trigger so an accepted tab-close request can finish after the browser request ends.
- Compact, keyboard-accessible notebook switcher with active-state indication, direct Add Notebook action, and a lightweight Manage Notebooks view.
- Dedicated responsive notebook onboarding flow outside Settings, including safe reuse of existing unassigned managed SSH keys with fingerprints and creation dates.
- Multi-entry notebook registry listing and activation APIs that preserve registered notebooks and switch active filesystem/Git services without a page reload.
- Managed SSH key administration in Settings with public-key copy, creation time, notebook assignment, unused-key identification, and confirmed deletion.
- Backend assignment revalidation that blocks deletion of notebook keys, malformed IDs, unsafe key directories, and keys whose assignment status cannot be established safely.
- Interactive provider-independent SSH host trust: discover presented host keys, display SHA256 fingerprints, require explicit approval, persist the exact approved keys, and automatically retry connection testing.
- Opaque, expiring host-trust approval requests with a second key scan to prevent arbitrary `known_hosts` injection and discovery/approval races.
- High-severity changed-host detection that displays previous and presented fingerprints while refusing automatic trusted-key replacement.
- Correct SSH host/port trust separation plus touch-friendly fingerprint review and copy controls.
- Milestone 5.1 per-notebook RepoQuill-managed Ed25519 SSH keys with persistent private material, public-key-only browser enrollment, and an advanced existing-server SSH alternative.
- Pre-clone connection testing with explicit success, host-verification, authentication, repository-access, and network failure states.
- Strict managed-key selection using isolated identities, batch mode, and a configured `known_hosts` file without automatic first-use trust.
- Security tests for private/public key separation, restrictive permissions, key-ID confinement, credential URL rejection, connection classification, and API response safety.
- Milestone 5 provider-independent Git service using direct `git` process arguments for status, commit, fetch, rebase, push, and manual synchronization.
- Separate repository Git state in the document status bar plus an explicit Sync action that waits for local save completion.
- Conflict detection with affected-file reporting, non-destructive sync failure states, and sanitized authentication/network errors.
- Clone-and-add workflow for existing Git repositories with optional branch selection, server-allocated working trees, and persistent active-notebook metadata.
- Local bare-repository tests for cloning, clean/dirty status, commit and push, no-change sync, remote integration, conflicts, failed remotes, and credential sanitization.
- Milestone 4.2 Settings maintenance workflow for scanning, reviewing, selecting, confirming, and deleting unreferenced image assets.
- Conservative Markdown reference resolution for relative, angle-bracket, percent-encoded, spaced, and nested asset paths.
- Per-file cleanup revalidation, failure reporting, repository confinement, symlink rejection, and safe empty `.assets` directory removal.
- Backend and frontend cleanup tests covering reference safety, manipulated paths, selection, confirmation, race revalidation, and deletion results.
- Sticky contextual image toolbar with Alt text, Replace image, and Remove image actions.
- Conservative image replacement that uploads a new asset and updates only the selected Markdown reference.
- Visual 10×10 table-size picker with hover/focus preview and touch-friendly selection.
- Cursor-relative table controls for adding or deleting rows and columns, deleting the table, and undoing structural edits through editor history.
- Responsive Milkdown formatting toolbar with undo/redo, block types, marks, lists, quotes, code, links, images, GFM tables, and horizontal rules.
- Active mark/block/list feedback and contextual image alt-text actions with accessible pressed and disabled states.
- Compact document status bar with save state plus live word, character, and line counts, structured for future Git sync status.
- Explicit per-note Edit/Read only toggle that prevents editor mutations without changing Markdown or repository metadata.
- Responsive Settings dialog with a persisted Off/1/5/15/30-minute editor auto-lock preference.
- Document-activity-based auto-lock that waits for autosave and ignores scrolling, pointer movement, and text selection.
- Contextual image metadata dialog for editing or clearing Markdown alt text on a selected image.
- Persistent light/dark UI switch that follows the system preference on first use.

- Touch-friendly image picker for camera/gallery uploads on supported mobile browsers.
- Per-note asset uploads using portable `<note>.assets/<random-name>` paths in ordinary Markdown.
- Confined image delivery with MIME detection, ownership checks, symlink rejection, and a 10 MiB upload limit.

- File-operation API tests covering collisions, traversal, symlinks, recursive deletion, and asset link updates.
- Local demo notebook with nested Lorem Ipsum notes and CommonMark formatting examples.
- Live WYSIWYG-style Markdown editing powered by Milkdown and CommonMark.
- Debounced autosave and explicit save controls with Saved, Unsaved, Saving, Failed, and Conflict states.

- GitHub Actions checks for Go, frontend, and container builds.
- Initial backend tests and project documentation.

### Changed

- Public project links and OCI image metadata now point to
  `github.com/fred-head/repoquill`.
- Automated Git commands disable repository hooks, HTTP responses include defense-in-depth security headers, and unsafe or trailing request data is rejected.
- Docker and CI frontend installs now use the reproducible npm lockfile through `npm ci`.

- Code blocks now use predictable Enter behavior: one Enter starts the next code line, two can create a blank line, and a third Enter at the block end exits into a normal paragraph.
- Code blocks use a compact code-specific line height, while Inline code can now be enabled at an empty cursor, typed into directly, and disabled again with the toolbar, slash command, or Escape.
- Polished editor controls with a true Blockquote toggle, explicit link creation/edit/removal, clearer active link state, accessible slash-command announcements, and compact paragraph spacing that distinguishes Enter from Shift+Enter.
- Code-block Enter handling now explicitly uses ProseMirror's single-newline command instead of browser-dependent contenteditable behavior.
- Note navigation now waits only for required local persistence; Git synchronization runs in the background with single-flight follow-up handling for edits made during an active sync.
- Recently synchronized clean notebooks suppress redundant note-switch syncs, and completed background syncs never reload or discard the active editor draft.
- Milestone 6 notebook navigation now syncs both the notebook being left and the selected notebook when switch synchronization is enabled, without conflating local save and remote sync failures.
- The sidebar header now exposes a single `Notebooks` switcher, while the active notebook name remains in the switcher menu, tree root, and creation context.
- Settings now focuses on configuration and maintenance; the duplicate notebook clone form moved to the primary notebook navigation workflow.
- Notebook switching completes local save first and clears note, selection, tree, and expanded-folder state before loading the newly active notebook.
- The primary note-taking UI now uses the configured notebook name in the sidebar title, tree root, creation target, and move picker instead of repository-oriented labels.
- Removing an image from the editor now removes only its Markdown node; stored asset files remain untouched for data safety.
- Contextual table controls now appear on the first table interaction and remain sticky beneath the main formatting toolbar while scrolling.
- GFM tables now scroll horizontally within the note on narrow screens, while table mutation controls remain hidden in Read only mode.
- The note formatting toolbar now stays visible directly below the top Edit/Read only and Save actions while scrolling.
- The Settings action now uses a crisp, platform-independent SVG gear icon instead of an emoji glyph.
- The compact document status bar is now anchored to the bottom of the editor viewport instead of leaving unused space beneath it.
- Long unbroken text now soft-wraps consistently in Edit and Read only modes without altering Markdown; code blocks retain horizontal overflow behavior.
- Auto-lock timers now invoke browser timer APIs through their global receiver, preventing an `Illegal invocation` blank screen when opening an editable note.
- Edit/Read only transitions now remount Milkdown with the current draft instead of mutating a live ProseMirror view, preventing a blank UI during auto-lock.
- Newly pasted or selected images now use empty Markdown alt text instead of the original upload filename.
- Note renames now rewrite CommonMark angle-bracket and percent-encoded asset paths when filenames contain spaces.
- Milkdown image nodes now use the inline image view so repository-relative asset paths are proxied for display without changing the stored Markdown.
- The image picker now inserts ProseMirror image nodes directly at the cursor instead of visible Markdown source text.
- Repository folders are collapsed by default.
- File operations now follow a selected-item explorer model with selection-relative global creation actions.
- Rename is inline, while Move uses a folder picker instead of repository-relative path input.
- Rename, Move, and Delete are contextual rather than permanently displayed on every tree row.
- Expanded folder state now survives tree refreshes, file operations, folder path changes, and browser reloads.
