# Security Maintenance and Vulnerability Response

This document defines how RepoQuill evaluates dependency updates, scanner
findings, published artifacts, and privately reported vulnerabilities. It is a
maintenance procedure, not a claim that automation can find every defect.

## Continuous signals

RepoQuill uses independent signals so a source commit is not required to detect
a newly disclosed vulnerability:

- Dependabot alerts and reviewed update pull requests for Go, npm, Docker, and
  GitHub Actions;
- CodeQL Extended analysis for Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, and workflow files;
- `govulncheck`, `npm audit`, static analysis, and complete-history secret scans;
- daily Trivy builds of the current source against fresh base images;
- daily rescans of both the newest immutable Alpha image and the moving Alpha
  channel tag;
- tag-gated multi-architecture release validation, SBOM generation, and signed
  provenance attestation.

Scheduled Trivy JSON reports are retained as workflow artifacts for 30 days.
Missing reports, scanner failures, and advisory-database failures are failures,
not clean results. GitHub workflow notifications are the initial maintainer
signal; the run summary identifies the reference or digest, component,
advisory, severity, installed version, and fixed version where known.

The repository variable `REPOQUILL_LATEST_ALPHA_VERSION` identifies the newest
immutable image tag for scheduled rescanning. It must be updated only after a
new immutable Alpha release completes successfully.

## Dependency pull-request policy

Automated dependency updates are untrusted code changes. They never merge or
publish automatically.

For every dependency pull request:

1. Identify whether the dependency affects development only, production,
   authentication/session/MFA, cryptography, SQLite, Git execution, the editor,
   PWA/service-worker behavior, or the container runtime.
2. Read upstream release notes and advisories. Check the maintainer and release
   status, license, changed transitive dependencies, and known breaking changes.
3. Keep major upgrades and security-sensitive updates separate from unrelated
   changes. Do not group authentication or cryptographic libraries.
4. Review the actual lockfile/module changes. `go.sum` and `package-lock.json`
   must remain reproducible, and CI must not create uncommitted dependency
   resolution.
5. Require the complete protected-branch checks: backend tests, race detection,
   `go vet`, `govulncheck`, frontend lint/tests/build, `npm audit`, secret scan,
   CodeQL, container build, Trivy, and runtime/persistence smoke tests.
6. For changes affecting authentication, session handling, MFA, cryptography,
   persistence, Git credentials, or PWA sessions, also run the dedicated
   Milestone 19 unit, integration, adversarial, expiry, recovery, and PWA tests
   once those controls exist.
7. Perform focused manual behavior testing when an update can change editor
   serialization, PWA caching, Git operations, persistence, authentication, or
   browser compatibility.
8. Merge only after a human maintainer accepts the risk and the branch is
   current. A green CI result is necessary but not sufficient.

Patch and same-release-line updates are usually lower risk, but Semantic
Versioning does not guarantee unchanged defaults, timing, serialization, or
security behavior. Auto-merge remains disabled. Introducing it later requires
a separately reviewed policy naming an extremely narrow development-only class.

## Finding triage

Every Dependabot, CodeQL, Trivy, `govulncheck`, npm, secret-scanning, or private
report receives the following assessment:

1. Record the affected source revision, release tags/digests, component,
   advisory or rule, severity, fixed version, and detection time.
2. Confirm the finding with a current advisory database or authoritative
   upstream advisory when possible. Do not dismiss it merely because a second
   scanner does not report it.
3. Evaluate reachability, attacker prerequisites, exposed data, authentication
   boundary, and whether RepoQuill's actual build includes the affected code.
4. Classify the response as affected, not affected, mitigated, false positive,
   or under investigation. Any dismissal must contain a specific technical
   rationale in the scanner's audit trail.
5. Identify supported releases and whether credentials, notebook data, Git
   remotes, hosts, or deployment boundaries may be compromised.
6. Choose remediation, temporary mitigation, upgrade/migration needs, and a
   rollback plan before publishing a replacement image.

Critical authentication bypass, remote-code-execution, credential disclosure,
path traversal, destructive data loss, and container escape findings receive
immediate priority. High and Critical findings fail source/image gates unless a
time-limited exception is reviewed and documented. A scanner outage never
qualifies for an exception that marks a release clean.

## Time-limited exceptions

An exception is a last resort when a finding is demonstrably unreachable or
mitigated and no fixed dependency exists. It must be committed as reviewable
security documentation and include:

- advisory/rule and affected component;
- affected versions and image digests;
- reachability evidence and compensating controls;
- owner and approval date;
- expiry date no more than 30 days away;
- upstream tracking link and removal condition;
- explicit confirmation that the exception does not cover authentication
  bypass, RCE, credential disclosure, traversal, destructive loss, or container
  escape without an extraordinary documented response.

Do not add broad ignore files, severity downgrades, or scanner exclusions merely
to make CI green.

## Remediation and release

Security fixes use a focused branch and pull request. Tests should reproduce the
unsafe behavior without publishing real credentials, private note contents, or
an immediately exploitable public proof before users can update.

A fix is released as a new immutable version and image digest. Existing Git
tags and immutable container tags are never moved. The release record identifies
affected and fixed versions, digest, SBOM/provenance evidence, limitations,
migration steps, mitigations, and rollback instructions. The moving Alpha tag is
updated only after the immutable multi-architecture image passes all gates.

If persistence, notebook metadata, authentication schemas, sessions, or Git
credentials are involved, validate the release with both fresh storage and a
representative copy of existing persistent data. Back up `/data` before testing
migration. Rollback must restore compatible application metadata from the backup
when a schema is not backward-compatible; canonical Markdown repositories remain
ordinary Git working trees throughout.

## Credential and disclosure response

If a credential may have been exposed:

1. Revoke or rotate it immediately at its authority (Git provider, proxy,
   registry, or other service).
2. Replace affected RepoQuill-managed keys and verify trusted host identities.
3. Inspect Git history, workflow logs, artifacts, images, caches, mirrors, and
   forks. Removing a secret from the latest commit is insufficient.
4. Preserve evidence without copying secrets into issues or ordinary logs.

Private reports remain confidential until affected users have a practical fix
or mitigation and coordinated disclosure is ready. Public advisories should
state impact, affected/fixed versions, remediation, migration, rollback, and
credit where appropriate without exposing private notebook data.

## Periodic maintenance review

Before each Alpha release and at least quarterly while maintained:

- confirm scheduled workflows still run and scanners receive current databases;
- review open/dismissed Dependabot, CodeQL, secret, and image findings;
- verify action SHAs, base images, security libraries, and tool versions remain
  maintained;
- verify the immutable-image repository variable and moving channel resolve to
  the intended release;
- exercise a scanner-failure path, a vulnerable test fixture where safe, fresh
  installation, representative-data upgrade, and rollback;
- confirm supported-version and private-reporting documentation is accurate.

These controls detect known advisories and recognizable unsafe patterns. They
cannot guarantee detection of unknown vulnerabilities, application logic flaws,
unsafe deployment, compromised maintainers, or mistakes in authentication
design. Security-sensitive features still require threat modeling and human
review.
