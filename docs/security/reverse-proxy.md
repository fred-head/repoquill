# Reverse-proxy and TLS security

RepoQuill's built-in authentication does not replace HTTPS. An Internet-facing
deployment must terminate TLS at a reverse proxy and keep the container's HTTP
port reachable only by that proxy. The default Compose mapping binds port 8080
to `127.0.0.1`; do not publish it on `0.0.0.0` unless another host firewall
provides an equivalent boundary.

## Trust only the proxy you operate

RepoQuill ignores `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`, and `X-Forwarded-Proto` from
ordinary clients. To accept them from a proxy, configure its exact source IP or
network:

```yaml
environment:
  REPOQUILL_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE: "true"
  REPOQUILL_TRUSTED_PROXIES: "172.20.0.5/32"
```

Multiple entries are comma-separated and may be IPv4 or IPv6 addresses/CIDRs.
Do not trust all private networks merely for convenience, and never use
`0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0`. Docker network addresses can change when a network is
recreated, so either assign a stable proxy address or use the smallest dedicated
proxy-network CIDR and ensure untrusted containers cannot join it.

The last trusted proxy must overwrite incoming forwarding headers instead of
blindly preserving values supplied by the client. RepoQuill then walks an
`X-Forwarded-For` chain from the nearest hop toward the client and selects the
rightmost address outside the configured trusted networks. A malformed chain is
ignored completely.

## Nginx example

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_pass http://repoquill:8080;
}
```

## Traefik and Caddy

Traefik and Caddy normally set forwarding headers automatically. Restrict their
trusted-forwarder configuration to the networks that actually precede them,
place RepoQuill and the proxy on a dedicated Docker network, and configure that
proxy network in `REPOQUILL_TRUSTED_PROXIES`. Do not add an interactive
forward-auth layer in front of RepoQuill's API; use RepoQuill's built-in local
authentication so the browser and installed PWA can understand session expiry.

## Request protections

Authenticated state changes require a random synchronizer token bound to the
server-side session and sent as `X-CSRF-Token`. SameSite Strict cookies and exact
Origin/Referer validation remain defense in depth. Cross-site browser requests,
scheme/host mismatches, and browser mutations without a usable origin are
rejected. API clients that do not behave like browsers still need a session and
CSRF token in local-auth mode.

Login failures are throttled with bounded progressive delays per resolved client
address and across the single-owner instance. Delays expire automatically and
never become a permanent network-triggered owner lockout.

The design follows the OWASP guidance for
[synchronizer CSRF tokens](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html),
[session cookies](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html),
and [login throttling](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html).
